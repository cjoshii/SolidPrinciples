# SOLID Principles

This project demonstrates the SOLID principles of object-oriented design. SOLID is an acronym that represents five important design principles for writing maintainable and scalable software.

## What are SOLID Principles?

### S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- A class should have only one reason to change
- Each class should be responsible for a single part or functionality of the system
- This principle helps in creating more maintainable and less coupled code

### O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification
- You should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code
- This principle helps in creating more flexible and scalable applications

### L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application
- Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes
- This principle ensures that inheritance is used correctly

### I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use
- It's better to have many smaller interfaces than a few larger ones
- This principle helps in creating more focused and cohesive interfaces

### D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions
- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions
- This principle helps in creating loosely coupled applications

## Project Structure
This project contains examples demonstrating each of these SOLID principles in C#.
